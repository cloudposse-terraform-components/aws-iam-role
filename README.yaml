# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning simple IAM roles. If a more complicated IAM role and policy are desired
  then it is better to use a separate component specific to that role.
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Global

  Abstract

  ```yaml
  # stacks/catalog/iam-role.yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      iam-role/defaults:
        metadata:
          type: abstract
          component: iam-role
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
  ```

  Use-case: An IAM role for AWS Workspaces Directory since this service does not have a service linked role.

  ```yaml
  # stacks/catalog/aws-workspaces/directory/iam-role.yaml
  import:
    - catalog/iam-role

  components:
    terraform:
      aws-workspaces/directory/iam-role:
        metadata:
          component: iam-role
          inherits:
            - iam-role/defaults
        vars:
          name: workspaces_DefaultRole
          # Added _ here to allow the _ character
          regex_replace_chars: /[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]/
          # Keep the current name casing
          label_value_case: none
          # Use the "name" without the other context inputs i.e. namespace, tenant, environment, attributes
          use_fullname: false
          role_description: |
            Used with AWS Workspaces Directory. The name of the role does not match the normal naming convention because this name is a requirement to work with the service. This role has to be used until AWS provides the respective service linked role.
          principals:
            Service:
              - workspaces.amazonaws.com
          # This will prevent the creation of a managed IAM policy
          policy_document_count: 0
          managed_policy_arns:
            - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonWorkSpacesServiceAccess
            - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonWorkSpacesSelfServiceAccess
